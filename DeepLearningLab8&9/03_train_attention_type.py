Step 03 : Main Experiment 1 (Section 14): attention type ablation A0 to A5 at P3.

Every run uses the identical protocol (Section 34): same split, preprocessing, augmentation, optimizer, schedule,
epochs, batch size, backbone and classifier. Only the factor under study changes.
Runs that already exist are skipped (FORCE=1 retrains; ONLY=B2,B4 trains a subset).

Outputs per run in outputs/results/runs/<run>/: history.json, metrics.json, outputs.npz
and the trained weights in outputs/saved_model/<run>.weights.h5
